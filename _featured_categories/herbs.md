### First attempt
This was my first foray into hydroponics and I learned a lot!
All of these herbs were bought from a garden store, cleaned of their dirt as best as I could and then planted in small rockwool cubes.
I believe that the majority of issues I ran into were related to the rockwool cubes and the roots not adapting well from soil to hydroponics. 
I ended the first herb garden due to a mold/mildew infestation on the rockwool.

### Herbs in the garden
| Herb | Notes |
| ---- | --- |
| [Basil](/hydroponics/basil) | Overall did well. I had some issues with stems getting moldy, but once those died. I'm currently having decent luck propagating it.|
| [Chives](/hydroponics/chives) | I replaced the parsley with chives and they did well. Their roots seemed to adapt the quickest. However, they did need a support and were a bit droopy.||
| [Sage](/hydroponics/sage) | Sage was growing well, and was even recovering from having all it's leaves trimmed off due to mildew. But, I attempted to re-root it and that seems to have killed it.|
| [Thyme](/hydroponics/thyme) | I had two thyme plants both of which died, I believe due to root rot. I also did not have luck propagating it either.|
| [Oregano](/hydroponics/oregano) | The oregano seemed quite happy. It was growing quickly and it's roots were doing better than most.|
| [Parsley](/hydroponics/Parsley) | Parsley seemed to be doing well, but I realized I just didn't cook with it. When I removed it there did seem to be some root rot.|
| [Rosemary](/hydroponics/rosemary) | The rosemary was not happy. Many of it's leaves were turning brown due to root rot from what I can tell.|
