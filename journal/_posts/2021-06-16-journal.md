> Seeds low on water, added more half strength. Rosemary has two leaves that are browning and curling. Removed them. Upon closer inspection, more like two dozen browning leaves. Removed them.
> 1290 PPM - 70.5F - Some different readings
> 5.73 PH - Took lots of different readings, but it eventually settled there.
> Moved seedlings to under big grow light, set for 7AM - 9PM
> Lowered Herb grow light

This is the beginning of the end of the Rosemary. It continues to have leaves brown more and more. I'm pretty sure it was due to the roots rotting as they were constantly wet and the internet tells me that Rosemary is more sensitive about that sort of thing than the other herbs I had.

I began to measure the PH and PPM of the nutrient solution here because my $20 (each) digital testers arrived. These aren't super accurate, and bounce around a fair amount. However, I use them as a general idea and trend line. I did not calibrate the PH meter because it looked like a pain and I'd have to do it pretty regularly. I've confirmed with PH testing solution (that came with my PH UP/DOWN kit) that it's in the ballpark.
