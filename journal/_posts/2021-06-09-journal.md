> Removed Sage and Thyme. Covered holes with foil. Soaking rockwool and pots in bleach solution. Chives, Basil, Oregano and Rosemary all doing fine.
> Changed water in tub. Filled to first line on bottom of net pots.
> One pair of cucumber seeds are doing very well. Poked above the top of the rockwool covering the hole.
