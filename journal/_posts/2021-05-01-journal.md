> Drained some water to get to correct level. Set up fan for 45% humidity.

I had not yet bought a dehumidifier, so I was trying to control the humidity with a fan. Given I bought a dehumidifier, you can guess how well that worked.

I drained some of the water as I was hoping that lower levels of water would fix some of the excess moisture issues I was having with the rockwool.
