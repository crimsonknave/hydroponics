> Added 8 cups of water. Thyme seemed to be drying out in places. Sage is growing sprouts.

At this point I still thought the thyme was dying because it's roots weren't getting enough water/nutrients. 
At this point I'm pretty sure it was root rot and parts of the plant was dying as parts of the roots died.
