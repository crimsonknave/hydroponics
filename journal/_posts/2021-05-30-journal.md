> Re-rooted everything but Parsley. Covered tops with tin foil. Started basting nutrient solution at top to aid root growth/flow. Replaced Thyme. Swapped Parsley for Chives.

When I re-rooted everything, I dumped the rockwool and roots out and then tried to seat the roots through the holes in the netpots and closer to the bottom. I did this as almost no roots had grown through the holes in the netpots. I believe that this killed the sage. I covered with tinfoil as previously I'd covered with cardboard and that had been getting damp so I'd removed it and I wanted a better solution. However, I believe this is what caused the mold on the rockwool, or at least made it worse. This re-potting didn't actually seem to really help much. The basting may have helped with the roots, but also made the rockwool super wet and I'm sure also contributed to the mold and root rot.
