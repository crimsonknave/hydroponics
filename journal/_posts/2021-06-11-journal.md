> Changed seedling water. Half strength water a bit higher than before. Cucumbers are doing well. Two cubes have two stalks fully out of the hole. Tomatoes are much smaller, but three are out of the hole.
> Trimmed a cucumber that was rooting at the top of the, picking the other as they were both strong.


The half strength water is water with half strength nutrients in it.

The two seeds per cube was excessive given that I had 4 cubes and only was going to keep two. But, it did mean that I was able to easily get rid of ones that were growing weird.
