> Cucumbers were low on water. Watered all seedlings with half strength. Moved the trays up onto the tub lid to get more light.

I now believe that I was using the half strength nutrient water too often here. Given that some/most of the water loss was due to evaporation and not transpiration the concentration of nutrients would have built up. I later realize this and try to flush it out, which just ends up getting the rockwool cube wet for longer and causing other issues. Both Tomato and Cucumber cubes have some "stains" that I believe are due to salt/nutrient buildup. The Cucumber cubes are worse.
