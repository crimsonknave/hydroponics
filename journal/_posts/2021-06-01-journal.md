> Piped some more water. Thyme looks a bit droopy. Got some Thyme and a Basil into water to propagate. Hopefully they will root and settle better in the tank.

I continued to baste ("piped some more water"). Thyme didn't propagate, but the Basil rooted decently in the water. I eventually transfer it to a rockwool cube and it adapted to that quite well.
