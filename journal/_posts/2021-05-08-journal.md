> Flushed all water with two 5 Gallon buckets. New food mix. Sage had mildew, pruned many leaves. 3 5 Gallon buckets with 6Tbps of food.

I drained out all of the water as it had been roughly three weeks and I thought the nutrients might have been used up. (I didn't have a TDS meter to check.)
I didn't want to do the whole bleach clean routine, so I filled up some buckets of water and rinsed it all down.

I did not change what type of food I was using, just noting I was giving it new food. It then occured to me I should note down how much I used.
