> Flushed water. Soaked tub with bleach, filled with 3 buckets and 6 Tbsp of food. Thyme is dying.

At this point I was changing the water based on time and also because I thought I had algae. I'm confident that I didn't need to change the water, but I also didn't have a TDS meter yet, so I can't say what the levels were.
