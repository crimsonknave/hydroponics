> Added 4 cups from dehumidifier and then researched and foudn out I probably shoudln't have.

I did this out of convienience. It was easier to add it from the bucket than a sink because my hydroponics are in the basement and there isn't a sink there.
However, after doing research I found out that the water from a dehumidifier is typically quite unclean as it pulls whatever particles are in the air including bacteria and fungus.
I'm not sure if this actually caused any problems, but it's still not a good idea.
