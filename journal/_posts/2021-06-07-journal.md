> Changed rooting water. Chives have good new growth. Watered cactus.

Rooting water got cloudy for me every few days, so I changed it with a new glass as well. The chives were adapting pretty well, I avoided cutting any of them for a while until there was good new growth and then only cutting 1/3 or 1/4 of the tallest ones.
