> One cucumber seed peering out. Chives are looking great. Good roots on chives, oregano, basil and rosemary. Starting to grow out of pots.

While there were some roots that were growing out, the vast majority of the roots from when the plants were in dirt didn't really end up growing and ended up rotting.
