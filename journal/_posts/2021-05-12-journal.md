> Added 12 cups of water. Thyme was looking wilty on one side. Thought the roots might have needed some water. Some basil was droopy too.

I'm pretty sure the basil was droopy due to the mold in some of the stems, not lack of water. 
The rockwool was still wet/damp and the water level wasn't below the net pot.
I believe that the thyme had root rot and that's why parts were dying.
