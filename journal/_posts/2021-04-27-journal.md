> Water levels still good. Have not had to add water. Basil had some moldy bits which I removed. One sage leaf moldy. Parsley and Basil have new growth.

As you can see, I'd added some cardboard covering the rockwool. There was some brown sediment in the water and some of the rockwool was turning brown.
At the time I believed that it was algae, so I covered it to prevent the light from helping to grow it. I now think it was dirt and some of the roots rotting possibly.

The mold I mention on the leaves became a larger problem and ended up getting into the rockwool. I also bought a dehumidifier later to help.
