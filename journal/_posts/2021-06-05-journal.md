> Started Tomato and Cucumber seeds. 2 per cube and 4 cubes.

I was planning on having two cucumber plants and two tomato plants. I had no idea how well the seeds would start, so I went a bit overboard. The two seeds per cube proved to be a bit of a pain. I believe that every seed sprouted and so I had to pick one to keep for ever cube and they didn't die right away when trimmed. It made it a bit hard to know which cube had the best roots as some of the roots might have been from the pruned seedling.
